BASIC JAVASCRIPT:
<br>
<br>
Variables are declared with var, and can store:
<br>
<br>
 booleans: true, false, null, undefined
 <br>
 example: var myBoolean = true
 <br>
 <br>
 Numbers: just write the number, decimals included
 <br>
 example: var myNum = 69.420
 <br> <br>
 Strings: 'Strings store text'
 <br>
 Example: var myString = 'hello there'
 <br>
 NOTE: strings can store numbers, but they will be treated as text. So, let's say I want to add two strings together. H and I, stored in variables string1 and string2, repectively. I could add them together with string1 + string2, resulting in the string "HI". Where these two features might cause problems is, let's say I want to add together the numbers 2 and 4, stored in num1 and num2, respectively, I would get 6, from the operation num1 + num2. BUT. if these numbers were stored as strings, and I had forgotten about this, it would add them together like strings, resulting in 2+4 = "24", instead of six. So, beware.
