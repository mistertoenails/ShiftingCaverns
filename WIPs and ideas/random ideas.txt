ending where you become the thing?
ending where the thing escapes?
maybe fighting the thing is entirely optional but gets you a different ending 
we should do some concept art of the thing in its entirety 

multiple endings you escape or you find the thing then escape
the thing helps you eventually
more than 1 thing
really loud but harmless bugs in the bug area that are based off cicadas
maybe bugs that charge out at you, as a jumpscare, either as randomly occuring events to keep players on their feet or triggered by going to a certain spot
maybe when you go near them
also maybe they could be based off grasshoppers
maybe you hear them hiss, then they charge, wait, screech and swipe
yes, but theyre hard to see, but you hear screeching 
sidesteps for dodging 
maybe you find out in the dungeon that these caverns used to have their own civilization that came to ruin
or in the ruins
due to the black stormy guy?
maybe for some reason the black storm can sense intelligence and kills it out of fear, so all the inhabitants evolved into mindless beasts
doesnt want you to find it because you would give it away
and the thing is hiding from the storm, an succeding, so the storm wants you to kill it and find it because youre so much more capable
we got the entire plot down at this point

the beginning room shouldnt have a down exit because its supposed to represent where you come in
